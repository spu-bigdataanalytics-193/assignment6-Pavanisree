       "Well, in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\n",

This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)</td><td>03 7, 2001</td><td>A10Q8NIFOVOHFV</td><td>Robert S.

(Most pictures of brush stands show them holding the brush at the comb, but I think that looks weird and top-heavy.  Call me weird, then.)  The arms are too narrow for the Omega.  I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.

(Then again, shaving brushes aren't exactly heavy, are they? They are not. The point is, you don't have to worry about it tipping it over if you don't have a brush yet. And if you don't have a brush yet, you should consider getting one of those next!) But I do in fact store one of my badger-hair brushes on the other side (the German-made one, of course!), and it stays in place pretty well. Much more satisfying than those little plastic stands a lot of brushes come with. The patterned steel in the middle of the stand is also an attractive element, adding visual interest and complementing the similar texture of the razor handle.

It is a very solid, well constructed hanger for both the brush and some razors.  The razor hanging side does not work for my particular razor (Mach 3 which is a rather dated design by a major manufacturer) but the brush holder is a must to help keep you beaver brush rinsed clean and allowed to dry.  The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?\n",
       "My primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.

       "Well, in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\n",

This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)</td><td>03 7, 2001</td><td>A10Q8NIFOVOHFV</td><td>Robert S.

I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.

(Then again, shaving brushes aren't exactly heavy, are they? They are not. The point is, you don't have to worry about it tipping it over if you don't have a brush yet. And if you don't have a brush yet, you should consider getting one of those next!) But I do in fact store one of my badger-hair brushes on the other side (the German-made one, of course!), and it stays in place pretty well. Much more satisfying than those little plastic stands a lot of brushes come with. The patterned steel in the middle of the stand is also an attractive element, adding visual interest and complementing the similar texture of the razor handle.

This is trivially fixable -- there's a little screw underneath the base, you just pop the rubber bottom off the base and tighten it), but I somehow managed to miss both that fact and the little note inside the box that explains it and sent it back for a refund with a grumpy comment. Pop! Shop noticed my confusion, and not only managed to explain my mistake to me without ever using the words \"you idiot\" (which is more than I would have been able to do, in their shoes), they sent me another one at no charge.

It is a very solid, well constructed hanger for both the brush and some razors.  The razor hanging side does not work for my particular razor (Mach 3 which is a rather dated design by a major manufacturer) but the brush holder is a must to help keep you beaver brush rinsed clean and allowed to dry.  The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?\n",
       "My primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.

Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it.

       "Well, in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\n",

       "excerpt from Black Diamond:  \"Only one thing is keeping them out of the big leagues, and that is the pigmentation of their skin.\" Shirley Povich washington post</td><td>02 26, 2010</td><td>A36NF437WZLQ9E</td><td>W. Powell</td><td>null</td><td>The Gift of Black Baseball</td><td>1267142400</td><td>false</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>0143026860</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)</td><td>03 7, 2001</td><td>A10Q8NIFOVOHFV</td><td>Robert S.

The first thing that I liked  was it had some natural  ingredients. The other was it being 7 in 1 you don't  have layers on top of layers. The instructions  were to use as 1 layer base coat add 2 coats of color if you  want  and  top off with 1 coat. It also serves as a quick drying coat. I did each  step  dried fast and it stayed on for a week until  I  stick something  between  my nail a polish and I  had to remove  my polish. No problems my nails  look great and I stated  over again. I will  keep  using it  it  kept  me from filling  my nails  and my cuticles have never looked better.

Months ago I went to my aunts house in NY and she was having the same issue, but she was using a couple of products from Deity of Hair. According to her in that moment, she was having good results. I decided to try them and started with the Shampoo and Conditionermonths later I noticed my hair was feeling stronger and in those areas that I was losing it, I had more! So why not giving a try to the rest of the products? I decided to order more shampoo, more conditioner, the Tibet Tonic Hair Growth Restorer, the Serum Gro Scalp Treatment and the Tibetan Deep Penetrating Conditioner. A month has passed since then and the results are really noticeable. I am not losing any more hair and it seems that I am recovering what was lost. I strongly recommend this products.

It doesnt absorb super fast, it maybe takes about 10 mins but that doesnt bother me since I use at bedtime.  I now consider it my anti-aging hand moisturizer. I recently starting using it as my under eye cream and it helps there too!  I'm super oily and acne prone so I haven't tried it all over my face yet, but I bet it would be ok.

It looks very high-tech with its articulated heads, but the bottom line is it shaves no better than my old model. I actually shaved half my face with the Arcitec and the other half with my old one. There was not the slightest difference in the closeness and I had the same amount of stubble on both sides 24 hours later. What's more, my old Norelco still has its original blades! It's also more solid and I think it's nicer to use. Also, the Arcitec has very little space beneath the cutters to hold the beard clippings, so you have to wash the heads after every use. Not a big deal, but I wash my old heads maybe once a week. So the Arcitec is going back.

I've been using a brow pencil for years but felt it was time for a change. I like the 3 different colors that came in the kit. It has 3 different plastic brow templates. 1 Slanted brush, tweezer and a lash wand are also included in the kit. The first time I tried this my daughter helped me to shape my eyebrows with the plastic templates. I didn't like the way they looked and she had a hard time using the templates. I finally practiced a couple of times still outlining my eyebrows with my pencil and then using the powder to fill them in. This way works so much better for me. The powder actually lasts throughout the day without coming off. I have no use for the tweezers, scissors but they're great to have. The slanted brush is a bit small but I've gotten used to using it to fill my eyebrows. The case has a magnetic type of cover that keeps it closed but you still have to be careful with it. I keep it in my makeup bag so I don't drop it. I don't think this will completely replace the way I currently shape and color my eyebrows but I'll continue to use it until the powders run out.

Updating my review to 1 star. The deodorant does work, and it smells good (I loved the rose one), but for $14, the deodorant should not be drying up less than half way through a bottle. It's sad, because I like the roller ball more than natural stick deodorants I've tried (they tend to be REALLY dry) but I really cannot justify this product! Nothing worse than taking a shower, getting out, and then having your deodorant all dried up so nothing comes out. First bottle, I was like meh okay, maybe I was sent a bad bottle. So I bought a second, and everything was great again--until it started drying up again. Then I started looking at reviews again, and I noticed a LOT of people are having the same issue. Plus, when it dries up, it gets VERY grainy and gets crystals everywhere. If they fixed this issue, I would go back to using this deodorant. I really did like the formula and how it worked and how light the scents are, but I'm not even getting half of the use out of a bottle. I would not recommend this product unless they fixed this.\n",

       "This is THE deodorant to use! I have struggled with finding a deodorant that actually works for a while now. I would start off fresh, but I would not stay that way. Sometimes, it wouldn't even last an hour! I tried every kind of antiperspirant available! I would spend my time in the deodorant aisle looking for the one that had the highest amount of antiperspirant. It was really frustrating to smell my BO after using such \"high strength\" products. One day at work, we got into talking about deodorant, and when I mentioned that I haven't found any I like and that none of them work, one of my coworkers asked if I used antiperspirant or plain deodorant. Of course I used antiperspirant! I was sweaty. He said that for many people, antiperspirant actually made it all worse. I didn't believe him at first, but decided to give it a try.\n",

So then i let my friend use it and she has naturally super curly hair. She used it after she had washed and blow dryed her hair . She loves it , as she normally uses a flat iron to get the smooth flat hair look. She turned the heat up to what she normally would have on her flat iron and it works well. I would only suggest not using it soon as you get out of the shower. I did do a video of her using it since you do need to use both your hands to use this brush. I will update it at a later date with pictures of her naturally curly hair. But overall it is a nice hot brush that you can use to get the sleek look for your hair.

Guess what, Mr. Sensitive Face says get this razor! My face used to be red for a couple of hours, now it is never red. The razor glides very smoothly, doesn't sting or burn, and the gel/lotion which seems expensive at the cash register goes a long way. Battery life is excellent, I can travel out of town for a week at a time without the charger. The product feels good, works well, I strongly recommend it to everyone. Note: buy the liquid cleaner and lubricant spray. They are required to maintain the product. The ONLY down-side to this razor is that it takes regular cleaning to keep it smelling fresh, even though it is rinsed under the tap after each use. My rating = 100%.

That automatically had me researching and interested! And No Lie, within a good 2 weeks to a month I've definitely seen improvement! This clay (mask) is good with sensitive skin, pulls out impurities and does the job AND WELL!

Depends on what your face needs are and what type of skin you have, etc. But nbs I will be honest, my skin has started to calm down, soothe refine and tone or cope well to form a natural nice-like complexion.

       "AirCut cons-did not cut hair as well as the Flowbee.  Had to go over the head many times, with less pleasing results.  I had to use the AirCut both forwards and backwards over any areas of hair that naturally lay flat .  The repeated cutting caused the hair ends to frizzle. The ends of the hairs were chopped, not cut, and tangled as I combed thru.\n",

       "Well, in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\n",

Powell</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)</td><td>A10Q8NIFOVOHFV</td><td>Robert S.

(Most pictures of brush stands show them holding the brush at the comb, but I think that looks weird and top-heavy.  Call me weird, then.)  The arms are too narrow for the Omega.  I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.  So I put it back into its original shape.  Ill save as its a very good stand, and if I get a brush that will work the way I want to suspend the brush, I certainly will use this.\n",

The rubber bottom, while it helps to keep the unit from sliding around, has the added caveat of remaining wet for a long period of time after a shave.  How do you dry it?  I don't know.  Perhaps by turning it on its side until it air dries.  In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.  I guess the unit is okay as long as you can leave it out, but I would still recommend placing it on  a dry paper towel after shaving to prevent mildew from forming and, worse, spreading.

(Then again, shaving brushes aren't exactly heavy, are they? They are not. The point is, you don't have to worry about it tipping it over if you don't have a brush yet. And if you don't have a brush yet, you should consider getting one of those next!) But I do in fact store one of my badger-hair brushes on the other side (the German-made one, of course!), and it stays in place pretty well. Much more satisfying than those little plastic stands a lot of brushes come with. The patterned steel in the middle of the stand is also an attractive element, adding visual interest and complementing the similar texture of the razor handle.
